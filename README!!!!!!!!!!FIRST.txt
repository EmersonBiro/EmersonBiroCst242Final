MY PROJECT USES MYSQL, TO GET ITS DATA.
YOU DONT NOT NEED A LOCALHOST DATABASE, BECAUSE I HOST IT FROM MY COMPUTER

SO AS LONG AS MY COMPUTER IS ON, YOU CAN LOGIN WITH THE FOLLING ACCOUNTS TO TEST

CAP SENSITIVE

Student account:
user: student1
pass: student1

user: student2
user: student2

Faculty account:
user: faculty
pass: faculty


Admin account:
user: admin
pass: admin

the core features work. hopefully

if there is any problem connecting i provided the tables that i used.
